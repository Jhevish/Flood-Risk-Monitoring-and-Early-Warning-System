# Flood-Risk-Monitoring-and-Early-Warning-System
Early Warning System for flash floods

# ABSTRACT
Flash floods are one of the most destructive natural hazards around the world including Mauritius
resulting in casualties, loss of lives and properties. This project aims at designing and
implementing an Early Warning System for flash floods in Mauritius which would help to alert
the residents about the catastrophe beforehand and lessen the loss of lives and property.The main
requirements of the system are low cost, effectiveness and reliability. The project entails both
monitoring the different parameters concerning flash flood and warning locals in the event of a
flash flood. Different sensors are chosen to monitor the parameters related to flash floods such as
temperature, moisture, water level and flow rate and data is transmitted through the Reyax
Module. The parameters are then displayed on Cayenne dashboards and the Blynk application.
The data is collected using an Arduino Uno and sent to the receiver consisting of a NodeMCU.
When a flash flood event is detected a trigger is sent to the user via SMS or email to warn them
about the imminent flooding. The Gumbel distribution is used to forecast flooding based on
historical rainfall data.

# Aims
The principal motive of this project is to design and implement an Early Warning System for
flash floods in Mauritius.
1.3.2 Objectives
The objectives are as follows:
i. Monitoring and storage of sensors’ data related to flash floods.
ii. Implementation of communication technology between transmitter and receiver.
iii. Flash flood prediction and notification.
iv. Use of Meteorological data to predict flash floods
1.4 Project Scope
The main features of the Early Warning System are:
1. Transmitter: The transmitter collects the real-time sensors’ data from the river and sends
it to the receiver for processing.
2. Receiver: The receiver processes the data and monitors it on dashboards.
3. Communication Technology: A proper communication link is established between the
transmitter and receiver to allow sending and receiving of data.
4. Data monitoring: The data collected from the receiver are monitored on dashboards.
5. Alarm: An alarm is sent to the residents in case of a flash flood warning.
